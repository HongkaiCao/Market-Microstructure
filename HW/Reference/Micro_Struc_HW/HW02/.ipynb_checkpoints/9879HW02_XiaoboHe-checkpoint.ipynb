    "As in the model predictions, an increase in book depth on the bid­side decreases the probability of a limit buy order, a decrease in book depth on the ask­side decreases the probability of a market sell order in subsequent periods and so decreases the probability of a limit buy order.\n",

    "The reason is that in Parlour model, at most one limit order is allowed to be filled at each time step. As the result, the probability of a limit order to be filled will be lower when there is a larger book depth. For the same reason, shorter book depth on the ask side will attract the trader to submit limit sell orders and increase the probability of a limit buy order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there is a herd effect for the autocorrelated order signs. A market sell will decrease the bid side to increase the probability of a limit buy order. This in turns will decreases the probability of a subsequent market buy, and leads to a larger queue on the offer side. This positive feedback will leads to an increase in the probability of a market sell.\n"
